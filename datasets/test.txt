as
the

A
subject
requiring
initiation
of
mechanical
ventilation,
non-invasive
ventilation,
or
a
high

nasal
cannula
is
a
subject
that
has
any

the

of
any
such
device
on
any
day.
The

as
being
in
categories
4,

of
the

ordinal
scale
being

Efficacy
on
Day
29
will
be
evaluated
using
the
same
6-point
severity
scales
that
is
used
at
Day
15.
Time
to
improvement
of
one
category
on
the
6-point

scale
will
be
determined
as
the
number
of
days
from
baseline
to
the
first
day
that
an
eCRF
indicates
a
one
category
improvement
in
the
scale.
A
48-hour
improvement
in
SpO2/FiO2
consists
of
two
consecutive
days
where
the
case
report
forms
show
a
clinically
meaningful
increase
from
baseline.
The
time

in
the
in
the
NEWS2
scale
will
be
determined
as
the
number
of

to
the
first
eCRF
that
shows
an

A

for
24
hours
on
the

consists
of
a
day
where
all
of
the
reported

The
change
in
NEWS2
scores
will
be
determined
as
the

at
Day
15
and
at
Day
29.
The
number
of
unique
subjects
alive

A
day
with
a

respiratory
rate

is
a
day
in
which
all
eCRFs
collected
for
a
subject
indicate
observed
respiratory
rates
>
24
breaths
per
minute.
A
day
with
supplemental
oxygen
is
one
in
which
any
case
report
form
collected
on
that
day
indicates
the
use
of
any
amount
of
supplemental
oxygen.
Time
to
saturation
greater

equal

90%
on
room
air
is
measured
by
the
number
of
days
from
baseline
to
the
first
day
on
which
an
eCRF
indicates
saturation
greater
than
or
equal
to
90%
without
any
supplemental
oxygenation.
A
ventilator
free
day
is
a
day
in
which
all
of
the
eCRFs
collected
indicate
that
the
subject
was
not
using
a
ventilator.
SOFA
scores
will
be
determined
from
eCRFs.
Values
will
be
determined
for
subjects
at
admission
to
an
ICU
and
for
all
subjects
still
in
an
ICU
at
the
end
of
the
study
(Day
29).
The
number
of
days
of
hospitalization
will
be
determined
from
eCRFs.
A
hospitalization
day
is
any
day
that
it
is
shown
that
a
subject
spent
at
least
spent
part
of
the
day
in
a
hospital.
Time
